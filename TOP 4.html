<h1 align =center>4. EDSA Shrine</h1>
<p>The EDSA Shrine, also known as the Shrine of Mary, Queen of Peace, and Our Lady of EDSA, is a small church of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Manila located at the intersection of Ortigas Avenue and Epifanio de los Santos Avenue (EDSA) in Quezon City. It is a monument dedicated to the first People Power Revolution and its peaceful outcome on December 15, 1989. It is a place that witnessed the two demonstrations that overthrew the presidencies of Ferdinand Marcos and Joseph Estrada. This shrine is a towering proof that fighting for freedom doesnâ€™t have to be a blood-spattered cause. Rather, it can be achieved through peaceful means and with no casualty.</p>
