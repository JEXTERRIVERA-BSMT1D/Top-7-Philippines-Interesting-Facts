<h1 align =center>5. Barasoain Church</h1>
<p>Having earned the title as the Cradle of Democracy in the East, Barasoain Church is the most important religious building in the Philippines. It was founded by the Augustinian Missionaries in 1859 and served as the session hall of Malolos Congress, the first congress in the Philippines which was held in September 15, 1898 under the presidency of Pedro Paterno. Three major events in the Philippine history happened in this church: the convening of the First Philippine Congress (September 15, 1898), the drafting of the Malolos Constitution (September 29, 1898 to January 21, 1899), and the inauguration of the First Philippine Republic (January 23, 1899). The architectural design of the church attracts and engages visitors because of the curved fa√ßade, rose windows, and medieval bell tower. Its floral motifs and paintings of angels and saints along the ceiling adorn the interior of the church.</p>
