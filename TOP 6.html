<h1 align =center>6. Leyte Landing Memorial Park</h1>
<p>If you ever drop by Tacloban City, the Leyte Landing Memorial Park, formerly known as the “McArthur Park,” is a must-visit destination. Remember the promise made by Gen. Douglas McArthur “I shall return”? He kept this promise when he returned with an army of 700 ships containing 174,000 American soldiers at Red Beach, Palo, Leyte on October 20, 1944. The “red” in Red Beach doesn’t refer to the natural color of the sand, but its color after being drenched in blood. Many tourists visit the park to reminisce an important event in history – the fulfilment of Gen. McArthur’s promise to the Filipinos to come back and help them win against the Japanese colonies. It always brings inspirational memories of how our beloved ancestors fought for our freedom.</p>
