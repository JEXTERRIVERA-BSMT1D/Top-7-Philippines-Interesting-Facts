<h1 align =center>3. Intramuros</h1>
<p>Intramuros is known in history as the “Walled City” because of its most famous feature: a nearly three-mile-long circuit of massive stone walls and fortifications that almost completely surrounds the entire district. It is the oldest district and historic core of Manila where old Spanish era influences are still plentiful. Photography and history lovers will find Intramuros an interesting destination. If you visit the place, you can still feel the Spanish ambiance and appreciate the historical landmarks and churches in the area. Plus, visiting Intramuros is very affordable and worth your time. Going here, you can re-experience the past in a modern light.</p>
