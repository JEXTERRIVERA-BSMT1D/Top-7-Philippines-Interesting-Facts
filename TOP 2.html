<h1 align =center>2. Corregidor</h1>
<p>Known to be the “the Rock”, Corregidor is known for its important historical attractions. When the Japanese invaded the Philippines, Corregidor became the headquarters of the Allied Forces and also the seat of Philippine Commonwealth government. The huge firearms of Corregidor which are used in support for Filipino and American defenders of Bataan are now silent but the damage seen on buildings, structures, and tunnels in the island continues on telling a very moving story of a war that has claimed so many lives. A visit to this former battleground is a memorable experience, especially for those people who value and cherish freedom and peace.</p>
