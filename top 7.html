<h1 align =center>7. Fort Santiago</h1>
<p>Fort Santiago, located in Intramuros, is a famous tourist destination in the Philippines. It is a historical structure that is part of the city’s famous wall. The attraction of the site is a museum where you can find a replica of Dr. Jose Rizal’s prison cell before he was executed. The rest of Fort Santiago has been set up into a beautiful park. There is also an imitation of old dungeons – dark underground chambers or cells used to confine prisoners. You can just imagine how hard it is to be imprisoned, tortured, and executed in one of them.</p>
